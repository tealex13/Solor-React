MVP
Show board
	-Create a 6 by 7 row of holds
	-render all the holds
	-reverse the render order
	-Give each hold a color
	-Map an array of colors to each hold
	-create a suffle command
	-Make each hold a random color

Cards
	-create card component
	-display cards
	-generate (draw pile) of card data
	-suffle the card data
	-display the first two cards in the array
	-display number of a cards dynamically
	-display color on cards
	-colors are displayed dynamically
Controls
	-display draw button
	-change the draw index when the draw button is pressed
	-Hide the draw button when there are no cards left to draw
	-Only display as many cards in the last set

Limbs
	-display limbs on all the holds
	-make top limbs visible over the hold
	-conditionally display limbs on holds
	-pass in limbs to display as properties
	-display limbs on two rows below the holds
	-display weight
	-Select limb to make it active
	-Obtain coordinates of seleced hold
	-Set limb coordinates of active limbs to coordinates of selected hold 
	-Set isAtStart to false when moved to a new coordinate
	
Cleanup
	-refactor limb attributes to be an object
	-Seperate Hold data from limb data when passing it into tile
	-Use active from limbData object

Rules:
	-Come up with the a list of rules an the order in which to implement them

Limited Distance Rules:	
	-Calculate distance between two coords tool
	-Limbs can only move distance of 1
	-Create limb groups
	-limbs in group cannot be > 3 apart
	-Can't select same hold as limb starts on
	
Extra
	-Make selected limb different color
	
Move according to card:
	-Create card permutations tools
	-Remove permutations that do not follow a move sequence
	-Limbs moved create a sequence
	-Limbs movement must match the sequence of a permutation
	
Cleanup:
	-Replace at start with -1 row index
	
	holdHandleClick only calls move limb if a limb is selected

Start rule
	-Ignore distance of 1 rule when moving from start 
	-Limbs can only move to row 1 when moving from start
	

Rules V2:
	Weight
		Make weight selectable
			?Make tile a grid?
		Write down movement rules
	
Only one limb per hold:

Feet can't move above hands:

left can't be more than 1 to the right of right:

Edge Cases:
	limbs not in group cannot be more than double max the distance apart (this covers the edge case where leftHand is on the wall, then right foot is placed on the wall froms start)
	
Moves are undo-able
	
Mark Used Cards:
	

Cleanup Round 2
	Seperate tile generation from hold mapping
	
Extras
	make the limbs images
	give cards dropshadows
