MVP
Show board
	-Create a 6 by 7 row of holds
	-render all the holds
	-reverse the render order
	-Give each hold a color
	-Map an array of colors to each hold
	-create a suffle command
	-Make each hold a random color

Cards
	-create card component
	-display cards
	-generate (draw pile) of card data
	-suffle the card data
	-display the first two cards in the array
	-display number of a cards dynamically
	-display color on cards
	-colors are displayed dynamically
Controls
	-display draw button
	-change the draw index when the draw button is pressed
	-Hide the draw button when there are no cards left to draw
	-Only display as many cards in the last set

Limbs
	-display limbs on all the holds
	-make top limbs visible over the hold
	-conditionally display limbs on holds
	-pass in limbs to display as properties
	-display limbs on two rows below the holds
	-display weight
	-Select limb to make it active
	-Obtain coordinates of seleced hold
	-Set limb coordinates of active limbs to coordinates of selected hold 
	-Set isAtStart to false when moved to a new coordinate
	
Cleanup
	-refactor limb attributes to be an object
	-Seperate Hold data from limb data when passing it into tile
	-Use active from limbData object

Rules:
	-Come up with the a list of rules an the order in which to implement them

Limited Distance Rules:	
	-Calculate distance between two coords tool
	-Limbs can only move distance of 1
	-Create limb groups
	-limbs in group cannot be > 3 apart
	
Extra

	-Make selected limb different color
	
Start rule
	Ignore distance of 1 rule when moving from start 
	Limbs can only move to row 1 when moving from start
	
Move according to card:
	-Create card permutations tools
	-Remove permutations that do not follow a move sequence
	-Limbs moved create a sequence
	-Limbs movement must match the sequence of a permutation
	
Only one limb per hold:

Feet can't move above hands:

left can't be more than 1 to the right of right:
	
Rules V2:
	Weight
		Make weight selectable
			?Make tile a grid?
		Write down movement rules
	
Cleanup Round 2
	Seperate tile generation from hold mapping
	
Extras
	make the limbs images
