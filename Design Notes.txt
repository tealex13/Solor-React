Notes:
	Need more options, difficulty that ramps as the game progresses, and abilities that improve as the game progresses
	
	[Concept: Levels of goodness
	Problem:
		Right now there are four levels of move goodness: 
			-no move
			-sideways move that enables another up move
			-up
			-up move that enables a future up move
		A moves goodness is usually pretty clear/an optimal goodness for a set of inputs can usually be calculated pretty easily
	
	Solutions:
		Compressing the levels of goodness
			Add another necessary resource that is orthagonal to the primary objective, moving limbs up the wall, and assign those to lower levels of goodness
			Ideas for orthogonal resources:
				-Overall Stamina
				-Arms get pumped
				-Gain knowlege
					-What colors will be on the next card
				-Increase your options
					-Upgrades
					-card draw
					-Situational advantage
						-Setting yourself up for next turn (you don't know if it will enable an up move but it could)
						-Ability to use cards in new ways (weight on limb)
			Ideas for less optimal actions
				-Spend movement in a way that does not directly contribute to the end objective
					-Simple Movements
						-sidways moves
						-downwards move
						-No move (discard a card)
					-Perform a specific move/ limb arrangement
						-Heel hook
						-Match feet or hands
						-Dynamo
						-Bumping
					-discard a card
			Increase the cost of performing the optimal move
				-limbs become immovable
					-over extended limbs
					-limbs that block eachother
					-weight on limb
				-Lose abilities
					-Weight can't be placed on the same space
				-Move weight in an undesireable direction
					-Add constraints how the card must be used
						-always top to bottom, 
						-or hand does top, foot does bottom
						-negociable for a price
				
		
		Increase move permutations (less obvious optimal solutions)
			Increase Options:
				-more cards
				-less colors
				-more ways to use cards
				-multiple color options per hold

	[Problem: Weight on limbs is overpowered
		
	Solutions:
		-Only allows performing a move that is a level of difficulty higher (not a wild)
		-Restrict motion of nearby limbs (not just the limb with the weight)
		-Make it more difficult to achieve
			-Some Holds cannot support weight
			-Can't move to weight from below
	]
	
	[Problem: The bearing on this round has low knowable impact on future rounds (no long term thinking is encouraged)
	
	Solutions:
		-Make the impact of this round on future rounds more "knowable"
			-Gain knowlege about next rounds cards
				-You can see the cards that you have used and the cards you haven't drawn yet
				-See the backs of the cards
				-see limited information about the fronts of the cards
				-Add cards back into the draw pile
			-Certain paths are more difficult than others
				-Forked paths forcing players to choose one side or another
		-Upgrade (encourages long term stategy)
		
	
	
	Concreate Ideas:
		Fewer colors but levels of difficulty
		Stamina or technique points for:
			Sideways moves 
			Downward moves
			Tranfering weight from one limb directly to another
			Having two limbs on spaces that are very far apart
		The wild side of card is not just a weight move (Increases the value of the next card)
			
	Ideas for upgrades that do not overpower:
		Perform a move that is a level more difficult once each round (could earn one color at a time, "mastery" of a color type)
		See the back of the next card (I really like this one because it gives you incomplete information, if there is red on the back then the front is not a red, but you probably won't use the back if you can help it)
		See the front of the next card	
		Allow a hold to support weight
		Draw a card
		Save a card or move for next round
		Switch a card from the discard with a card in the draw pile
		Move a card from the top of the pile to the bottom
